#' Full Conformal prediction intervals, Multivariate Response
#'
#' Compute prediction intervals using full conformal inference with multivariate
#' response
#'
#' @param x Matrix of features, of dimension (say) n x p.
#' @param y Matrix of responses, of length (say) n X q.
#' @param x0 Matrix of features, each row being a point at which we want to
#'   form a prediction interval, of dimension (say) n0 x p.
#' @param train.fun A function to perform model training, i.e., to produce an
#'   estimator of E(Y|X), the conditional expectation of the response variable
#'   Y given features X. Its input arguments should be x: matrix of features,
#'   y: vector of responses, and out: the output produced by a previous call
#'   to train.fun, at the \emph{same} features x. The function train.fun may
#'   (optionally) leverage this returned output for efficiency purposes. See
#'   details below.
#' @param predict.fun A function to perform prediction for the (mean of the)
#'   responses at new feature values. Its input arguments should be out: output
#'   produced by train.fun, and newx: feature values at which we want to make
#'   predictions.
#' @param alpha Miscoverage level for the prediction intervals, i.e., intervals
#'   with coverage 1-alpha are formed. Default for alpha is 0.1.
#' @param mad.train.fun A function to perform training on the absolute residuals
#'   i.e., to produce an estimator of E(R|X) where R is the absolute residual
#'   R = |Y - m(X)|, and m denotes the estimator produced by train.fun.
#'   This is used to scale the conformal score, to produce a prediction interval
#'   with varying local width. The input arguments to mad.train.fun should be
#'   x: matrix of features, y: vector of absolute residuals, and out: the output
#'   produced by a previous call to mad.train.fun, at the \emph{same} features
#'   x. The function mad.train.fun may (optionally) leverage this returned
#'   output for efficiency purposes. See details below. The default for
#'   mad.train.fun is NULL, which means that no training is done on the absolute
#'   residuals, and the usual (unscaled) conformal score is used. Note that if
#'   mad.train.fun is non-NULL, then so must be mad.predict.fun (next).
#' @param mad.predict.fun A function to perform prediction for the (mean of the)
#'   absolute residuals at new feature values. Its input arguments should be
#'   out: output produced by mad.train.fun, and newx: feature values at which we
#'   want to make predictions. The default for mad.predict.fun is NULL, which
#'   means that no local scaling is done for the conformal score, i.e., the
#'   usual (unscaled) conformal score is used.
#' @param score Method to compute nonconformity measure in the multivariate regime.
#' The user can choose between squared l^2 norm of the residual,
#' mahalanobis depth of the residual, the max norm of the residual, or a scaled max
#' @param num.grid.pts.dim Number of grid points per dimension used when forming the conformal
#'   intervals (each num.grid.pts.dim^q points is a trial point). Default is
#'   100.
#' @param grid.factor Expansion factor used to define the grid for the conformal
#'   intervals, i.e., the grid points are taken to be equally spaced in between
#'   -grid.factor*max(abs(y)) and grid.factor*max(abs(y)). Default is 1.25. In
#'   this case (and with exchangeable data, thus unity weights) the restriction
#'   of the trial values to this range costs at most 1/(n+1) in coverage. See
#'   details below.
#' @param verbose Should intermediate progress be printed out? Default is FALSE.
#'
#' @return A list with the following components: pred, valid_points. The first
#'   is a matrix of dimension n0 x q, while the second is a list of length n0, containing in each
#'   position a matrix of varying number of rows (depending on which points where accepted by
#'   the method) and with a number of columns equal to q + 1. Indeed, valid_points contains the
#'   selected points on the y-grid as well as the p-values.
#'
#' @details Due to eventual computational overload the function is restricted to a bivariate y.
#' @details This function is based on the package \code{\link{future.apply}} to
#'  perform parallelization.
#'
#' @details If the data (training and test) are assumed to be exchangeable, the basic
#'   assumption underlying conformal prediction, then the probability that a new
#'   response value will lie outside of (-max(abs(y)), max(abs(y))), where y is
#'   the vector of training responses, is 1/(n+1).  Thus the restriction of the
#'   trials values to (-grid.factor*max(abs(y)), grid.factor*max(abs(y))), for
#'   all choices grid.factor >= 1, will lead to a loss in coverage of at most
#'   1/(n+1). This was also noted in "Trimmed Conformal Prediction for
#'   High-Dimensional Models" by Chen, Wang, Ha, Barber (2016) (who use this
#'   basic fact as motivation for proposing more refined trimming methods).
